The "Optimal Fashion MNIST Classification" project is a data science initiative aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using machine learning and deep learning techniques. To this end, the project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the classification process, and investigates various methods for optimizing the performance of this model. These methods include:

    - Hyperparameter optimization (HPO): Fine-tuning the model's internal parameters to improve performance
    - Dimensionality reduction: Using techniques such as autoencoders and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the data and speed up computation
    - Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Using tools like Numba to compile the classification code on the fly, resulting in faster execution

Through the implementation and comparison of these approaches, the "Optimal Fashion MNIST Classification" project aims to identify the most effective techniques for achieving high performance on the Fashion-MNIST classification task
